# sumuntil

Description:
This Java program reads integers from the user and calculates the sum of all non-negative numbers. The process stops immediately when a negative number is entered.

How it Works:

The user is prompted to enter numbers.

Each number is added to the total sum if it is non-negative.

The loop stops when a negative number is input.

The final sum is displayed.

Input Example:

Enter the numbers:  
5  
3  
2  
-1
Output:
10
Note:
Maximum of 10 inputs are allowed, but the program will exit early if a negative number is entered.
